#!/usr/bin/env bash
# guardrail/kit-drift.sh — says that the DEPLOYED kit tree no longer matches this checkout,
# at the moment the gap opens: a pull, a branch switch, a rebase.
#
# Nothing wires this. install.sh already points core.hooksPath at this directory for the
# commit guardrail, so post-merge, post-checkout and post-rewrite arrive with git pull the
# same way pre-commit does, and a fresh clone gets them the first time install.sh runs.
#
# WHY IT LIVES IN THE CHECKOUT. The deployed tree is a file copy with no .git and records
# no path back to its source, so it cannot tell whether it is current. The checkout can:
# install.sh's destination is a convention (CLAUDE_SESSION_KIT_PREFIX, else ~/.claude), so
# the checkout looks FORWARD to the deploy instead of the deploy looking back. That removes
# the need for a stored source path, which would rot the first time the checkout moved.
#
# WHY IT COMPARES CONTENT, NOT THE VERSION LABEL. Every commit changes `git describe`, so a
# label comparison fires through all of normal development and gets ignored. What matters is
# whether the files install.sh actually deploys have changed since the deployed commit. A
# pull touching only docs/, tests/run.sh or skills/ is silent, which is the point.
#
# skills/ is deliberately out of scope: it ships in the plugin, not in this tree, and its
# staleness is `claude plugin update`, not install.sh. install.sh reports that separately.
#
# Committed states only. Uncommitted library edits in the working tree are work in progress,
# not a stale deploy, and warning about them would fire on every save.
